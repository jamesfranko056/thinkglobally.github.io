<h3>Communicating with Us</h3>
<p><em>We may be required to provide certain disclosures, notices and communications (collectively “Communications”) to you in written form as part of the Services.  </em>You agree and consent to receive electronically all Communications that we may provide you in connection with your account and your use of the Services.

<h3></h3>
<p><em></p>
<h3>Using the Services</h3>
<p><em>In order to use the Services, you must subscribe to an active voice service plan and keep your account in good standing.  </em>An account is in good standing when all charges for the Services that are due are paid in full and your designated payment method for the Services is valid.  For more information about services and charges, please see the <a href="#subscription-information" onclick="return false;" data-accordion-toggle="subscription-information" ng-click="accordion.toggle(2, 'subscription-information', true)">Subscription Information</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Services are offered only to residents of the United States.  </em>The Services must be primarily used in the United States and are not intended for extended international use.  Further, the Services are designed for use predominantly within our network.  If your usage outside our network is excessive, abnormally high, or cause us to incur too much cost, we may, at our option and sole discretion, suspend your account, terminate your service, or limit your use of roaming.</p>
<p><em>You agree not to misuse the Services, which includes using the Services for purposes that are illegal, are improper, infringe the rights of others, or adversely impact others’ enjoyment of the Services. The Services are intended for personal use only, and you may not resell the Services directly or indirectly, except as explicitly approved by us in writing.  </em>Please see the <a href="#acceptable-use-policy" onclick="return false;" data-accordion-toggle="acceptable-use-policy" ng-click="accordion.toggle(3, 'acceptable-use-policy', true)">Acceptable Use Policy</a> for more information, including examples of misuse.</p>
<p>Using the Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content you access using the Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in the Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with the Services.</p>
<h3>Billing and Payment</h3>
<p>The Services aren’t free, so we do need the following commitments from you:</p>
<p>You agree to pay all applicable charges for the Services you use, whether ordered by you, someone authorized by you, or someone with access to your Services or account.</p>
<p><em>You agree to pay recurring monthly charges in advance of the billing cycle in which you will receive the Services.  </em>We will bill one-time charges in the billing cycle following your authorization of such charges.</p>
<p><em>You authorize us to automatically collect payments of all charges associated with your use of the Services from your designated payment method.  </em>Along with your bill, we will notify you of the date that the amount you owe will be collected via your designated payment method.  We will send all bills and other required notices by email to the address associated with your account.  We may also make them available in your account via the  Website or Application.  Bills are typically emailed or otherwise made available to you one to two days after the end of your billing cycle.  We reserve the right to amend or correct any bill within 180 days following the date we issue that bill.</p>
<p><em>If payment is not received due to insufficient funds or for any other reason, we may, consistent with applicable laws, assess late payment fees, suspend, and/or limit the Services.  </em>To bring your account back into good standing, you will be required to pay all outstanding amounts for your services that are due and unpaid.  We may also terminate your account.  If we terminate your account, any unused services will be forfeited.  We reserve the right to send unpaid bills to third party collection agencies.</p>
<p><em>You must have a valid Google Payments account and use Google Payments for payment transactions relating to the Services.</em> If you do not already have a Google Payments account at the time that you sign up for the Services, you will be required to create one.  Please be aware that your use of Google Payments is subject to its <a href="https://payments.google.com/termsOfService?type=Buyer&gl=US">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://payments.google.com/legaldocument?family=0.privacynotice">Privacy Policy</a> (which incorporates the Google Privacy Policy by reference), to which you must agree to utilize Google Payments’s services. Not responsible for any third party charges you may incur in connection with your Google Payments account, credit card, or other payment method.</p>

<h3 id="emergency-services">Important Information about 911 and Emergency Alerts</h3>

<p><em>Calling 911.  </em>When making calls to a public-safety answering point (PSAP) from a mobile device, such as dialing 911, you should always be prepared to provide your location and your phone number.  Unlike calls from a traditional wireline phone, a PSAP may not know the emergency caller’s location or phone number.  Although some local emergency authorities have enabled enhanced 911 services (“E911” or “Enhanced 911”) that use Global Positioning Satellites (“GPS”) or other methods to determine callers’ locations, E911 does not always provide accurate location information.  If your mobile device is indoors, cannot acquire a satellite signal, or otherwise cannot obtain your location, your location may not be automatically delivered to the PSAP.  Also, the process of porting a phone number may limit the Services such that we may not be able to provide location services to PSAP during that time.</p>
<p><em>Calls to 911 over Wi-Fi also operate differently than traditional wireline calls to 911.</em> Calls to 911 over Wi-Fi may not connect to the PSAP or may improperly ring to the administrative line of the PSAP, which may not be staffed after hours, or by trained 911 operators.  If your call connects to a PSAP, your location information and phone number may not be transmitted, and you may need to provide your location and other information to the PSAP.  Calls to 911 may be limited or unavailable if your device is set to Wi-Fi only mode and you are experiencing a power outage, any disruption in your Wi-Fi service, or if you are otherwise unable to access the Internet.  If you would like to print a warning label for your device about the limitations of this service, you can view and print one <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/499F69483983FCB011053E57A86D9E73A305">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>If you are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech disabled and need to reach emergency services, call 911 directly using TTY or a telecommunications relay service.  </em>Where possible, do not rely on 711 in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p><em>Please be aware that, in providing you the Services, we may assign your device other phone numbers in addition to your personal phone number.  </em>If you make a 911 call, the 911 operator may see a phone number that is different from your personal phone number.  There may be instances when the PSAP might not be able to call you back.</p>
<p><em>Place of Primary Use.  </em>In order to use the Services, you are required to register a physical address with us that may be used to route emergency calls and services if your location isn’t immediately known.  This address should be the place where you expect to primarily use the Services.  It is important that you review and update this address as needed.  You can update this address at any time on the Website or Application.  You will have to log into your account in order to make changes.  We will not accept P.O. Box addresses.  Learn more about updating your place of primary use address.  You may also reach out to customer support.</p>
<p><em>Text-to-911.  </em>Text-to-911 is the ability to send a text message to reach PSAPs from your mobile phone or device.   Currently, the Services do not support text-to-911 sent over a Wi-Fi network.   If your device is set to Wi-Fi only mode, you cannot reach PSAPs by sending a text message.  In the event of an emergency, you should make a voice call (or TTY) to 911 when possible.</p>
<p><em>Emergency Alerts.  </em>Emergency alerts can be enabled or disabled in your device settings.  Even if enabled, Cell Broadcast, Emergency Alert System, and Wireless Priority Services messages are not always able to be sent to your device.  Be aware that your device may not receive these messages if your device is set to Wi-FI only mode or no cellular signal is available.  If you set the device volume to low or vibrate only, your device may receive these messages but you may not receive an alert sound.</p>
<p><em>Emergency Services Outside the United States.  </em>When you are traveling outside the United States, you may not be able to reach PSAPs by dialing 911.  Where possible, we will attempt to reroute 911 calls to emergency services located in the country from which you are calling.  Emergency calling is not available in all countries and may not be reliable where it is available.</p>
<h3>Coverage and Quality of Services</h3>
<p>Our coverage maps only approximate our anticipated wireless coverage area outdoors under optimal conditions.  The actual service area, coverage, speed, and quality of service may fluctuate based on numerous factors such as signal strength, network congestion or capacity, hardware limitations, software, server speeds of the websites, portals or other locations on the Internet that you use, the weather and any other factors that are beyond our control.  Outages and interruptions in the Services may occur, and Services, including calls or attempted calls to emergency services like 911 calls, may be interrupted or fail.  The Services that rely on location information, such as E911 or GPS navigation, may depend on network coverage and may depend on your device’s ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) or cell antenna sites.  We do not warrant or guarantee that the Services will be available at any specific time or geographic location or that the Services will be provided without interruption or at any particular quality level.  As we improve the Services, coverage maps may change over time.</p>
<h3>Network Management</h3>
<p>We are committed to providing an excellent user experience that supports any lawful product, service, or application that its subscribers choose to access through the Services.  To do so, we engage in reasonable network management practices.  Please see the <a href="#network-policy" onclick="return false;" data-accordion-toggle="network-policy" ng-click="accordion.toggle(4, 'network-policy', true)">Network Policy</a> for more information about those network management practices.</p>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p><em>We take your privacy seriously. You understand and agree that information provided to and collected by connection with the Services is subject to the <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a> and the <a href="#privacy-notice" onclick="return false;" data-accordion-toggle="privacy-notice" ng-click="accordion.toggle(5, 'privacy-notice', true)"href="">Privacy Notice</a>.  </em>The Privacy Notice provides information about how we use your data and your Customer Proprietary Network Information rights.  To learn about the steps that takes to protect your information, please see the main Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<h3>Keeping Your Account Secure</h3>
<p><em>The security of your account depends on you keeping your Account password confidential and securing access to your device connected to your account.  </em>It is your responsibility to control access to your device and your account, including enabling a lock screen on your device and keeping your passwords confidential. If you share your account information or device with a third party, he or she may have access to your account and your personal information.  It is also your responsibility to alert us if you believe that the security of the information in your account has been compromised.</p>
<h3>About Data Services &amp; Data Content</h3>
<p><em>The Services may display or allow you to access third party content, such as text, pictures, video, games, graphics, music, email, applications, sound, and other materials ("Data Content") or send Data Content elsewhere.  </em>Data Content may be: (1) unsuitable for children/minors; (2) unreliable or inaccurate; or (3) offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You're solely responsible for evaluating the Data Content accessed by you or anyone through your Services.  Data Content may also harm your device or its software.  We are not responsible for any Data Content.  Data Content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review Data Content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display Data Content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.</p>
<h3>Modifying the Terms and Service Plans</h3>
<p><em>We may modify these Terms and any additional terms that apply to the Services to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to the Services.  </em>We will post the changes on the Website.  We will provide you with notice of material changes and may provide you notice of non-material changes.  Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen (14) days after they are posted on the Website or otherwise made available to you, except that changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately.  If you are unhappy with any change we make, you may cancel your Services at any time.</p>
<h3>Cancelling Your Services</h3>
<p><em>You may cancel the Services at any time.  </em>In the event of cancellation, you agree to pay the balance of any outstanding charges remaining at time of cancellation.  You also agree to pay any additional bill that we provide you after cancellation for charges you incurred while your account was active, but that had not yet been billed to your account at the time of cancellation.  If your account is in good standing, we will provide you a prorated refund for unused Services.  Learn how to cancel your Services <a href="http://support.google.com/fi?p=cancel_service">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h3>
<p>We provide the Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we do not promise about our Services.</p>

</ul>
<p>WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW,  AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.</p>

<h3>About these Terms</h3>
<p>These terms control the relationship between and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p>If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>

<p>The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>

    <p><em>The Privacy Policy</a> applies to all of the services offered by and its affiliates, including the Services.  </em>This Privacy Notice provides additional information about how we collect and use personal information.</p>
<h3>Customer Proprietary Network Information</h3>
<p><em>We take protecting your Customer Proprietary Network Information or “CPNI” very seriously.  </em>In fact, federal law requires telecommunications providers, like, to protect certain personal information that we generate or access in providing the Services to you.  CPNI includes call details, call location information, and information about the rates and features of the Services that you use.  CPNI does not include your name, address, or phone number.</p>
<p>Here are the ways we protect your CPNI:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Securing your CPNI.  </em>We implement safeguards that are designed to protect your CPNI.  We must authenticate you with a password or other permissible means before we disclose any CPNI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Using CPNI without your additional approval is limited to specific purposes.  </em>By using the Services, you allow us to use, disclose, and permit access to your CPNI without your additional approval only for the following limited purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>To provide and offer services among the category of Services you’re purchasing from us.  </em>This includes using CPNI in the normal course of business, such as to enable billing, customer service, and troubleshooting.  This also includes related features such as call blocking, call return, repeat dialing, call waiting, caller ID, and call forwarding.</li>
<li>To provide information services, such as Internet access and voicemail.</li>
<li>To protect our rights and property.</li>
<li>To protect our users and other carriers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses of the Services.</li>
<li>Comply with applicable laws and legal process.</li>
<li>Any other purpose permitted by federal law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Using CPNI after you choose to opt-in (by default you are opted out).  </em>From time to time, we may want to provide you information about communications-related services that are not among the category of services that you’re already purchasing from us.  You can opt in to receiving this information.  You are not required to opt in and your decision not to opt in will not adversely affect how we provide you the Services that you’re purchasing from us.  Only if you opt in may we use your CPNI to market you communications-related services and share your CPNI with our affiliates and agents in order to provide you those services.  Once you opt in, that opt in remains in effect until you affirmatively revoke your opt in or cancel the Services.  Learn more about how to manage your opt-in <a href="https://support.google.com/fi/answer/6181037?p=privacy&rd=1">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Using CPNI with your additional approval.  </em>Except as provided above, we will not use, disclose, or permit access to your CPNI without your additional approval.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Information we collect</h3>

</ul>
<p><em>Pay Monthly Device Plan Information.  </em>When you apply to purchase a device on the Pay Monthly Device Plan, we may collect information you provide us in connection with that application, such as your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, or other information.

</ul>
<h3>How we share information</h3>
<h4>Sharing with third parties</h4>
<p>We will only share your personal information with other companies or individuals outside of and our affiliates in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>

<h3>A few things to keep in mind</h3>
<h4>Information you may be sharing when you make phone calls</h4>
<p><em>When you place calls using the Services, your phone number may be displayed to the person you’ve called.  </em>If you do not wish to have your phone number displayed, you may choose to block the display of your phone number by dialing *67 prior to dialing the number of the person you wish to call.  Blocking your phone number information in this manner does not prevent the display of your information when you dial certain business numbers, including 911 or toll-free numbers.</p>
<h4>Information you may be sharing when you use the Internet</h4>
<p>When you browse the Internet, use mobile applications, or otherwise access the Internet, the Mobile Directory Number (“MDN”) assigned to your mobile device and/or other device-specific information may be transmitted over the Internet. It is possible that third parties can use the MDN and other information to identify your device.</p>

    </h2>
    <core-collapse class="scroll-on-expand">
    <p><em>We are committed to providing an excellent user experience that supports any lawful product, service, or application that its subscribers choose to access through the Services.  </em>To do so, engages in reasonable network management practices.  This Network Policy generally describes our network management practices and is subject to change at any time.</p>
<h3>Network Management</h3>
<p><em>We use various network management techniques to protect our network, systems, equipment, services and users from harm, ensure reliable, quality services to our users, and improve our services.  </em>These network management practices can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using automated systems to analyze network traffic to detect and prevent the distribution of spam and malware.</li>
<li>Allocating network resources amongst users and devices in manner that promotes the best experience for users.</li>
<li><em>Limiting or suspending heavy, continuous data usage that adversely impacts our network’s performance or hinders access to our network.  </em>For example, we may automatically terminate any call that exceeds two hours in duration.</li>
<li>Limiting or suspending usage that we reasonably suspect is unlawful, fraudulent, or does not comply with the Acceptable Use Policy.</li>
<li>Restricting access to any telephone number and/or certain categories of telephone numbers (e.g., 9XX numbers other than 911), certain websites, portals, or any messages or content.</li>
<li>Not providing calling capability, including connections to certain geographic locations and special services numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>To provide the Services, we also rely on networks, systems, equipment, and services provided by our suppliers.  </em>Our suppliers may also engage in their own network management techniques to protect their networks, systems, equipment, and services from harm, and such network management can impact the Services.</p>
<h3>Roaming</h3>
<p><em>We may choose to allow users to roam (receive service from other networks) in our sole discretion.  </em>Whether we allow roaming depends on a number of factors, including the radio transmissions that devices can receive. We make no guarantee that roaming coverage will be available, and we are not responsible for roaming networks.  Depending on your mobile device settings, you may automatically roam if there is a gap or interruption in coverage within our network area and roaming coverage areas.  Limits on the amount of minutes, number of texts, and amount or speed of data services used while roaming may be applied.  Certain Services or features may not be available in roaming coverage areas, and call quality may be lower while roaming. Reserves the right to deny roaming to any device at any time.</p>
<h3>Device Management</h3>
<p><em>You may only use the Services with supported devices.  </em>A supported device is a device that conforms to all the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>does not potentially harm the Services, our network, or our suppliers’ networks;</li>
<li>complies with Federal Communications Commission regulations;</li>
<li>utilizes an operating system supported by Services; and</li>
<li>is certified by us for use on our network.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We will list supported devices on the Website.</em> Not all supported devices are the same, and the Services may perform differently on different devices.  Also, some Services may not be available on all supported devices and operating systems, and some features will be available only on devices purchased from us.  Modifications or customizations to your operating system could impact the performance or availability of the Services.</p>
<p><em>We reserve the right to suspend any device that we reasonably determine is unsupported.  </em>Using an unsupported device may enable you to use third party services while roaming outside our network.  If you use such third party services, you are responsible for all third party charges that you incur, and we may pass those charges to you as part of your bill.  Third party charges may be substantially higher than the usage fees we charge for use of the Services within our network.</p>
<p>We do not allow stolen devices to use the Services and reserve the right to deny providing services to any device that has been reported stolen or that we reasonably believe may be stolen.</p>
<h3>Telephone Numbers and IP Address</h3>
<p><em>When you sign up for the Services, we may assign you a personal phone number (the "Personal Number").  </em>We can change, reassign, or eliminate your Personal Number by giving you notice.  We may also assign an Internet Protocol address ("IP Address") to your wireless device and can change, reassign, or eliminate your IP Address without giving you notice.  You may not assign the Personal Number or IP Address to any wireless device, other equipment or to any other party except as approved by us.</p>
<p><em>In addition to your Personal Number, we may assign your device other phone numbers (each an “Additional Phone Number”).  </em>We use these Additional Phone Numbers to operate and manage the Services, and they may not be made apparent to you.  We can change, reassign, or eliminate any Additional Phone Number at any time in our discretion without giving you notice.</p>
<p><em>You may port your Personal Number to another carrier at any time while your account is still active.  </em>Please be aware that, once the Personal Number for any device has been ported out, it will no longer be able to use the Services.  Consequently, we may treat any request to transfer a Personal Number to another carrier as a request for cancellation. We don't guarantee that any porting of numbers to or from us will be successful.</p>
<h3>Software Updates</h3>
<p><em>In order to provide you the Services, we provide you software on your device.  </em>We may automatically update that software on your device once a new version or feature is available.  These changes could affect your stored data or how you have programmed or use your wireless device.</p>

<p>Open source software is important to us. Some software used in the Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.</p>
<h3>Suspected Fraud</h3>
<p><em>In certain circumstances, a supplier on which we rely may terminate your Services immediately if that supplier detects fraud.  </em>In such circumstances, we do not have control over the termination but will work with you to restore Services if you believe it was done in error.  If we suspect fraudulent activity with any of the devices on your account, we will notify you of the potential fraud.  We may also suspend your device from using some or all of the Services.</p>
<h3>Information about Security</h3>
<p>We make an effort to keep our network secure, but no network’s security is perfect. You should be sure to take whatever steps you believe are necessary to ensure that your data is not accessed by unauthorized third parties. Please be aware of the following:</p>

    <h3>Overview of the Services</h3>
<p><em>Descriptions of the Services are provided below.  </em>As we are constantly changing and improving our Services, we may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether at any time, in our sole discretion.  We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important.  If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.  All Services are subject to our network management practices.</p>
<p><em>The Fi Basics.  </em>The Fi Basics are available for a recurring flat monthly fee and provides the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited number of voice minutes within the United States.</li>
<li>Unlimited Wi-Fi calling within the United States.</li>
<li>Unlimited Wi-Fi calling to the United States when you travel in certain countries.</li>
<li>Unlimited number of SMS and MMS texts within the United States and the 120+ Supported Countries.*</li>
<li>24/7 Live Support.</li>
</ul>
<p>*<em>The 120+ Supported Countries are those countries where makes its Services available for use when you are traveling in those countries.  </em>Over time, we may include additional countries within 120+ Supported Countries.  We may also remove countries at any time.  We provide a list of the 120+ Supported Countries on the Website.</p>
<p><em>Data Usage.  </em>Data usage includes web browsing, application usage, downloading content (like applications, games, etc.), ringtones and similar activities.  If applications running in the background use your data connection, such usage will be accounted as part of your data usage.  Data usage is available to you as follows:</p>
<p>Prepaid Data:</p>
<p><em>You prepay for data use in the United States in 1 gigabyte (“GB”) increments on a recurring, monthly basis.  </em>The minimum monthly amount is 1GB.  After you prepay, your data usage will be deducted from your prepaid data in 1 megabyte (“MB”) increments.
If, at the end of your billing cycle, you do not use all your prepaid data and your account is in good standing, then we will credit your account an amount equal to the difference in the amount you prepaid for data for that billing cycle and the prorated amount for your actual data usage in the United States without going under your actual usage.</p>
<p>Pay-As-You Go:</p>
<p>If your data usage in the United States exceeds the amount that you have prepaid, we will charge you for data you have used in 1 MB increments.
<em>For data usage in countries other than the United States, you will be charged for data you use on per MB basis.  </em>The applicable rate per MB may vary by country.  Charges will appear in the international section of your bill.</p>
<p><em>International Calling.  </em>Wi-Fi calling to the United States is included as part of the Fi Basics without an additional fee.  All other calls between two different countries (such as cellular calls placed between the United States and another country and Wi-Fi calls between non-US countries) will be charged on a rate per minute basis. Calls will be rounded up to the nearest minute.  The applicable rates vary per country.</p>
<h3>About Usage Fees for Services</h3>
<p><em>We will provide information about our usage fees and rates on the Website or the Application.  </em>The details, prices, and allowances of the Services may change at any time.  The type of fees that you incur will vary depending on the Services you choose to use.</p>
<p>We charge three different types of usage fees for the Services:</p>
<p><em>Monthly Recurring Fees.  </em>Some Services, like the Fi Basics, are available for a monthly recurring fee.  For any Services with a recurring monthly fee, those fees must be paid in advance of the month in which you will receive the Services.  If a monthly recurring fee for a Service that you have subscribed to is changed, the change will be effective at the next billing cycle, and you will receive notification of the pending change.</p>
<p><em>One-Time Fees.  </em>Some Services, like calls from the United States to other countries, are available for a specific fee or rate per use.  We will bill one-time charges in the next billing cycle following your authorization of such charges.  There may be some instances, due to delay in our systems, where the charges appear in a later billing cycle.</p>
<p><em>Additional Fees.  </em>Depending upon the Services used by you, there may be additional charges for calls to or from certain locations, including without limitation payphones and areas within extended calling zones. There may also be applicable charges for any special or enhanced services you use.</p>
<h3>About Taxes, Surcharges, and Other Fees</h3>
<p>In addition to usage fees, you agree to pay all applicable taxes, surcharges, and other fees.</p>
<p><em>A Note about Surcharges.  </em>Surcharges are not taxes, and we are not required by law to assess them.  We choose, in our discretion, to collect surcharges from you to recover certain costs.  We determine the amount of each surcharge, and that amount is subject to change without notice, as are the components used to calculate that amount.  Examples of surcharges include, but are not limited to, Federal and State Universal Service fees, and regulatory and administrative fees.</p>
<h3>Managing Your Account</h3>
<p><em>Billing Cycles.  </em>When you first establish your account, you will approve your initial purchase of the Fi Basics and prepaid data and authorize automatic monthly charges via Google Payments.  Your billing cycle for all subsequent months will commence on the day that you activate the first device on your account (the “Cycle Start Day”), except that if the activation of the first device on your account occurs on the 1st, 28th, 29th, 30th, or 31st of any month, your Cycle Start Day will be the 2nd of all subsequent months.  For example, if the activation of the first device on your account occurs on March 28, 29, 30, 31 or April 1, your next Cycle Start Day will be May 2nd.  Subsequent monthly billing cycles will automatically renew on the Cycle Start Day of each subsequent month.</p>
<p><em>Disputing Charges.  </em>If you believe you were incorrectly charged by us, you must dispute those charges in writing within 180 days of the date we charge your account.  You accept all charges not properly disputed within the above time period.</p>
<p><em>Lost or Stolen Devices.  </em>If your device is lost or stolen, notify us immediately by calling customer support.  We reserve the right to hold you liable for all charges and fees incurred by your device until you have notified us of the alleged loss or theft and until such time as we can deactivate the device.  If we choose to investigate a lost or stolen device, you agree to cooperate in our investigation.</p>
<h3>Suspension and Termination of Your Account</h3>
<p><em>In certain circumstances, we may suspend or terminate your account in accordance with these Terms.  </em>For example, we may suspend or terminate your account if there is a late payment, suspected fraud, or we determine there is a violation of these Terms.  We may also suspend or terminate your account if your Google Account or Google Payments account is suspended or terminated.  If your account is suspended for any reason, you cannot make use of the Services for any purpose except for placing calls to emergency services.  When your account is terminated, all devices will be disassociated from your account and may permanently lose the current telephone numbers associated with such devices.  Even if you later bring your account into good standing, we will likely not be able to provide you with the telephone numbers that were associated with your devices prior to when your account was terminated.</p>
